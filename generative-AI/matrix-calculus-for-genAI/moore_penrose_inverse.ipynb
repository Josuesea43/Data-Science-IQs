    "### 1. **System of Linear Equations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "A system of linear equations can be written as:  \n",
    "$$ A \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b} $$  \n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ is the matrix of coefficients.\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the vector of unknowns.\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is the right-hand side vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to solve for $\\mathbf{x}$. This system can represent a variety of real-world problems, including statistical models, physics simulations, or optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Rank of a Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "The **rank** of a matrix $A$, denoted as $\\text{rank}(A)$, is the dimension of its column (or row) space. It represents the number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "- If $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, then $\\text{rank}(A) \\leq \\min(m, n)$.\n",
    "- A **full-rank matrix** has $\\text{rank}(A) = \\min(m, n)$. For square matrices, full rank implies that the matrix is invertible.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Importance:**  \n",
    "The rank gives insight into the solvability of the linear system. A higher rank typically means the system is more constrained, leading to fewer solutions or more specific solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Types of Linear Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear systems can vary based on the number of equations and variables. These types include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unique Solution (Full Rank, Square Matrix):**  \n",
    "  If $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and $\\text{rank}(A) = n$, the system has a unique solution:  \n",
    "  $$ \\mathbf{x} = A^{-1} \\mathbf{b} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overdetermined System (More Equations than Variables):**  \n",
    "  If $m > n$, the system may be inconsistent (no solution), the least squares solution minimizes the error $\\| A \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{b} \\|_2^2$:  \n",
    "  $$ \\mathbf{x} = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T \\mathbf{b} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Underdetermined System (More Variables than Equations):**  \n",
    "  If $m < n$, the system typically has infinitely many solutions. The minimum norm solution is found using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse:  \n",
    "  $$ \\mathbf{x} = A^+ \\mathbf{b} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Relationship Between Rank and Determinacy**\n",
    "\n",
    "The rank of the matrix $A$ determines the nature of the solution to the system $A \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Full Rank (Square Matrix):**  \n",
    "  If $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and $\\text{rank}(A) = n$, the system has a unique solution (if consistent).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Less Than Full Rank:**  \n",
    "  If $\\text{rank}(A) < n$, the system may have infinitely many solutions (if consistent) or no solution at all.\n",
    "  - If $\\text{rank}(A) < m$, the system may be inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rank is a key indicator of the solvability of the system, guiding us toward the appropriate method for finding solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Moore-Penrose Inverse**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse** $A^+$ is a generalized inverse of a matrix $A$, and it exists for any matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, whether square or rectangular. It satisfies four properties:\n",
    "1. $A A^+ A = A$\n",
    "2. $A^+ A A^+ = A^+$\n",
    "3. $(A A^+)^T = A A^+$\n",
    "4. $(A^+ A)^T = A^+ A$\n",
    "\n",
    "For matrices with full rank:\n",
    "- If $A$ has full column rank:  \n",
    "  $$ A^+ = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T $$\n",
    "- If $A$ has full row rank:  \n",
    "  $$ A^+ = A^T (A A^T)^{-1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Moore-Penrose inverse helps solve linear systems, even when they do not have a unique solution (as in overdetermined or underdetermined systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **How Moore-Penrose Inverse Solves Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse $A^+$ can be used to solve all types of linear systems, including underdetermined and overdetermined systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For a Unique Solution (Square, Full Rank):**  \n",
    "  If $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and $\\text{rank}(A) = n$, the Moore-Penrose inverse gives the unique solution:  \n",
    "  $$ \\mathbf{x} = A^{-1} \\mathbf{b} = A^+ \\mathbf{b} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For an Overdetermined System ($m > n$):**  \n",
    "  If $\\text{rank}(A) = n$, the least squares solution is:  \n",
    "  $$ \\mathbf{x} = A^+ \\mathbf{b} = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T \\mathbf{b} $$  \n",
    "  This minimizes $\\| A \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{b} \\|_2^2$, the sum of squared residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For an Underdetermined System ($m < n$):**  \n",
    "  If $\\text{rank}(A) = m$, the minimum-norm solution is:  \n",
    "  $$ \\mathbf{x} = A^+ \\mathbf{b} $$  \n",
    "  This minimizes $\\| \\mathbf{x} \\|_2$, ensuring the solution has the smallest possible magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Moore-Penrose inverse provides the best approximation to a solution, even in cases where the system does not have a unique solution."
