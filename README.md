# Data Science Interview Questions by @AIinMinutes

This repository contains a curated collection of data science interview questions, shared on my Threads page [@AIinMinutes](https://www.threads.net/@AIinMinutes). Topics range from foundational mathematics to cutting-edge deep learning concepts, aiming to support learners and professionals preparing for data science roles.

## Overview
The questions in this repository are designed to provide deep and comprehensive insights into data science concepts. Each answer strives to cover multiple facets of a topic, including mathematical foundations, coding optimizations, and any additional relevant aspects, ensuring that readers gain a well-rounded understanding of each subject.

## Topics Covered
While I haven’t yet settled on a strict structure for organizing the questions, I plan to broadly categorize them into the following areas:
- **Foundational Math**: Fundamental mathematical concepts essential for data science, including multivariate calculus, mathematical statistics, linear algebra, and graph theoyr.
- **Applied Statistics**: Core statistical principles, including descriptive and inferential statistics, probability, hypothesis testing, and statistical modeling.
- **Classical Machine Learning**: Algorithms and techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, clustering, feature engineering, model evaluation, and optimization.
- **Modern Deep Learning**: Advanced topics, covering neural networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, transformers, and optimization strategies in deep learning.

> **Note**: I am organizing the questions based on conceptual categories rather than by data modalities (e.g., text, image, time-series), focusing on principles and techniques that apply across different data types.

## Current Question Generating Processs
Currently, I follow a simple format to disseminate knowledge on Threads. I post random questions (as they come to my ENTP brain) that I have been asked or that I could potentially ask in a data science interview. Once I have a question ready, I refine it to cover as many topics as possible. Sometimes, I choose questions that are particularly thought-provoking to stimulate deeper discussions.

Transforming these questions into a structured repository is an ongoing process, and I welcome any suggestions or contributions from the community. If you have ideas for organizing the questions or enhancing the content, please feel free to raise an issue.

## How to Use
Each question is structured to encourage a deeper understanding of key concepts and their applications. Use this repository to:
- **Prepare for Interviews**: Study the questions to reinforce knowledge across a broad spectrum of data science topics.
- **Review Concepts**: Refresh foundational and advanced topics in data science, from statistics to deep learning.
- **Explore Multiple Perspectives**: Many questions incorporate discussions on multiple concepts to provide a nuanced understanding.

You can use GitHub’s search functionality to locate specific topics or keywords within the repository.
